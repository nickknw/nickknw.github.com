and after this book I start my tour of C, but after
that... it is time for SICP and Scheme. C is first for two reasons: it is kind of the lingua franca - I'm tired of coming across examples of things in C and having a hard time with pointers etc the more
comfortable I become in higher level languages the harder it will be to get
started with something as low level as C.
