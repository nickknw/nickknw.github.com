<div style="margin-bottom:.75em;"><strong>Summary: </strong>An implementation of Matt Might's proofreading scripts</div>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p><p>I wanted to make use of Matt Might&#8217;s <a href='http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/'>proofreading scripts</a>, but I&#8217;m on a Windows machine most of the time and would rather not rely on cygwin, a so I rewrote them in Ruby and customized them a bit.</p><p>I made sure to handle the case where a suspect phrase (e.g. &#8216;is used&#8217;, or &#8216;the the&#8217;) is split between two different lines.</p><p>The output has line numbers, includes the suspect words at the beginning of the line, and is more or less readable in the windows command prompt. It uses &#62;angle brackets&#60; to mark the word instead of color and tries to stay within a fairly short width.</p><p>When run, it automatically creates a file called <code>feedback-&lt;filename&gt;</code>. If it finds weasel words or passive voice, it adds a couple of short tips from Matt&#8217;s original blog post after the list of them.</p><p>These scripts are finished and working, but if you find any bugs please let me know.</p><h2 id='usage'>Usage</h2><div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>ruby proofread.rb <span class='o'>[</span>filename<span class='o'>]</span>
</code></pre>
</div><h2 id='example_output'>Example Output</h2><p>For a fun example, I ran this on Matt&#8217;s original blog post. It acts as a pretty decent test because the blog post itself must contain examples of suspect phrases in order to explain them.</p><p><strong>Weasel words results:</strong></p><pre><code> 73: various - My favorite salt and pepper words/phrases are &gt;various&lt;, a number of, fairly, and 
 73: fairly - My favorite salt and pepper words/phrases are various, a number of, &gt;fairly&lt;, and 
 74: quite - &gt;quite&lt;. Sentences that cut these words out become stronger. 
 76: quite -  Bad:    It is &gt;quite&lt; difficult to find untainted samples.  Better: It is 
 79: various -  Bad:    We used &gt;various&lt; methods to isolate four samples.  Better: We isolated 
 85: interestingly - &gt;interestingly&lt;, surprisingly, remarkably, or clearly. 
 85: surprisingly - interestingly, &gt;surprisingly&lt;, remarkably, or clearly. 
 85: remarkably - interestingly, surprisingly, &gt;remarkably&lt;, or clearly. 
 85: clearly - interestingly, surprisingly, remarkably, or &gt;clearly&lt;. 
 89: surprisingly - Bad:    False positives were &gt;surprisingly&lt; low.  Better: To our surprise, false 
100: very - The two worst offenders in this category are the words &gt;very&lt; and extremely. These 
100: extremely - The two worst offenders in this category are the words very and &gt;extremely&lt;. These 
103: several - Other offenders include &gt;several&lt;, exceedingly, many, most, few, vast. 
103: exceedingly - Other offenders include several, &gt;exceedingly&lt;, many, most, few, vast. 
103: many - Other offenders include several, exceedingly, &gt;many&lt;, most, few, vast. 
103: few - Other offenders include several, exceedingly, many, most, &gt;few&lt;, vast. 
103: vast - Other offenders include several, exceedingly, many, most, few, &gt;vast&lt;. 
105: very -  Bad:    There is &gt;very&lt; close match between the two semantics.  Better: There is 
117: completely -  Bad:    We offer a &gt;completely&lt; different formulation of CFA.  Better: We offer a 
207: few - A &gt;few&lt; words on marketing 

Look out for:
    Salt and Pepper words (various, fairly, quite)
    Beholder words (interestingly, surprisingly, clearly)
    Lazy words (very, extremely, several, most, few)
    Adverbs


Passive voice results:

 141: is guaranteed -  Bad:    Termination &gt;is guaranteed&lt; on any input.  Better: Termination is 
 141: is  guaranteed -  Bad:    Termination is guaranteed on any input.  Better: Termination is 
 155: were added -  OK: 4 mL HCl &gt;were added&lt; to the solution. 
 211: be accepted - writes has to &gt;be accepted&lt; for publication. 

For each use of the passive highlighted, ask:
    1. Is the agent relevant yet unclear?
    2. Does the text read better with the sentence in the active?
If the answer to both questions is &#39;yes,&#39; then change to the active.
If only the answer to the first question is &#39;yes,&#39; then specify the agent. 


Duplicated words results:

 175: the the -  Many readers are not aware that &gt;the the&lt; brain will automatically ignore a 
 180: the the -  Many readers are not aware that &gt;the the&lt; brain will automatically ignore a 
 181: instance instance -  second &gt;instance instance&lt; of the word &quot;the&quot; when it starts a new line.  </code></pre></p>
