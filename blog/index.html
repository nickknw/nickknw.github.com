  Seven Languages: Week 2 (Io) - Day 3
  </a></h1>
  <div class="faded" style="font-size:14px; margin-bottom:5px;">16 Jan 2012</div>
  <p>Since this is the last day of Io, I am going to reflect a bit on what I liked about it.</p>

<p>I learned that a small prototype-based language like Io can still be expressive and powerful. There are no classes or modules, but you don&#8217;t need them to put things together in a way that mimics classes or modules. It was very refreshing.</p>

<p>It also turned out that I got a practical result directly relevant to my current work from learning Io: it strengthened my understanding of javascript. The underlying way javascript works makes sense to me on a deeper level now. I am actually in the middle of reading <a href='http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do'>Javascript: The Good Parts</a>, and I can glance at the parts to do with explaining prototypes and think &#8220;Aha! This is obvious and makes total sense to me!&#8221; I am positive I would not have thought the same before this experience.</p>

<p>Io&#8217;s minimalism also whetted my appetite for learning a lisp. Clojure is coming up in a few chapters, and I am looking forward to it. Scheme is also on my horizon (if a bit farther out), but that&#8217;s a subject for another post.</p>
<div class='interjection'><p>
(This article is part of a series of posts I am doing about my journey through the exercises of the book <a href='http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks'>Seven Languages In Seven Weeks</a>. The article previous to this one is <a href='/blog/2012/01/11/seven-languages-week-2-day-2/'>Week 2 (Io) - Day 2</a>. For an overview see the <a href='/projects/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/'>project page</a>.)
</p></div>
<h2 id='topics_covered'>Topics covered</h2>

<p>The last day of Io covered some more advanced language features, mostly focused on metaprogramming.</p>

<p><strong>Metaprogramming and internal DSLs</strong> were the main focus of the text, the examples, and the exercises. But for good reason! Again Io&#8217;s firm commitment to letting you do whatever you want to (even up to the point of allowing you to cripple core language features!) shows the power it can give.</p>

<p>You can create custom behavior for curly brackets just by sticking a method into the <code>curlyBrackets</code> slot. You can redefine the colon operator by calling <code>addAssignOperator</code> with <code>:</code> and the name of the method you want to use. Io also has an equivalent to Ruby&#8217;s <code>method_missing</code>, except in Io it is called <code>forward</code> and it is a crucial part of prototypal inheritance.</p>

<p><strong>Example time!</strong> Say you send a message called <code>fly</code> to an object we&#8217;ll call <code>Mallard</code>. In this example, <code>Mallard</code> is a clone of the <code>Duck</code> prototype, and has some additional slots we don&#8217;t care about right now. The important thing is that <code>Mallard</code> <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> have a <code>fly</code> slot (it is probably defined in <code>Duck</code> or somewhere else further up the chain), so when we send the <code>fly</code> message to <code>Mallard</code> it will say &#8220;Huh, can&#8217;t do anything with this&#8221; and <em>forward</em> that message to its prototype to deal with.</p>

<p>Putting a method in the <code>forward</code> slot of an object lets us customize what happens when an object receives a message it doesn&#8217;t know what to do with. Instead of forwarding the message on to its prototype (as in the example above), we can start to do some pretty interesting things, which you will see in my highlights from the exercises.</p>

<p><strong>Concurrency</strong> was also talked about, and Bruce showed how Io can handle that with <strong>coroutines, actors, and futures</strong>. Futures and coroutines I am already familiar with, and it was nice to see how seamless they were to use in Io. I am pretty sure I didn&#8217;t really grok the section on actors.</p>

<p>In Io you can make an object into an actor just by sending an asynchronous message to it (which you do with <code>@@</code>). This may be cool but I&#8217;m not sure, because I don&#8217;t understand the implications of actors yet. Once I get to the Erlang section is likely when I&#8217;ll start learning more about them and this will start to be impressive in retrospect.</p>

<h2 id='highlights_from_exercises'>Highlights from exercises</h2>

<p>These exercises focused on expanding on the XML DSL example that was used to demonstrate <code>forward</code> during this chapter.</p>

<p>I was not really satisfied with my solution - I couldn&#8217;t manage to make it feel as elegant as my previous ones. It might be because this problem is inherently a little bit messy, or more likely, there are still some bumps in my implementation that could be smoothed out.</p>

<p>Io&#8217;s <code>forward</code> method, reflection abilities, and ability to redefine operators all played key roles in making a problem like this possible to solve with an internal (as opposed to <a href=''>external</a>) DSL. This saved a ton of time and effort on my part.</p>
<h3>Forward</h3>
<p>This is a simple stripped down chunk from the XML DSL example from the book. It lets you make a rudimentary XML DSL. The following section of code will turn <code>Builder div</code> into <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>. The downside is, it will also turn <code>Builder
span</code> into <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>!</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='io'>    <span class='n'>Builder</span> <span class='o'>:=</span> <span class='n'>Object</span> <span class='k'>clone</span>

    <span class='n'>Builder</span> <span class='n'>forward</span> <span class='o'>:=</span> <span class='k'>method</span><span class='o'>(</span>
        <span class='n'>write</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;&lt;div&gt;&quot;</span><span class='o'>)</span>
        <span class='n'>write</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;</span><span class='o'>)</span>
    <span class='o'>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div><h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>Reflection in Io was covered in Day 2 of the book, but it is an important part of this example. It provides the ability to access the <em>name of the message</em> that was sent with <code>call message name</code>. It also lets us start nesting calls by passing another function call as an argument. This example is complete enough that we can do <code>Builder ul(li(&quot;One&quot;), li(&quot;Two&quot;), li(&quot;Three&quot;))</code> and it will correctly print out <code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code>.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='io'>    <span class='n'>Builder</span> <span class='o'>:=</span> <span class='n'>Object</span> <span class='k'>clone</span>

        <span class='n'>call</span> <span class='n'>message</span> <span class='n'>arguments</span> <span class='n'>foreach</span><span class='o'>(</span>
            <span class='n'>arg</span><span class='o'>,</span>
            <span class='n'>content</span> <span class='o'>:=</span> <span class='n'>self</span> <span class='n'>doMessage</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='n'>arg</span><span class='o'>);</span>
            <span class='k'>if</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='n'>content</span> <span class='n'>type</span> <span class='o'>==</span> <span class='s'>&quot;Sequence&quot;</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='n'>write</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='n'>content</span><span class='o'>)))</span>
        <span class='n'>write</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;&lt;/&quot;</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='n'>call</span> <span class='n'>message</span> <span class='n'>name</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='s'>&quot;&gt;&quot;</span><span class='o'>))</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s go over that middle chunk that begins with <code>call message arguments</code>. Just as <code>call message name</code> will return the name, <code>call message arguments</code> returns a list of the arguments. We iterate over that list with <code>foreach</code>, and for each <code>arg</code> we do two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Execute it with <code>self doMessage</code>. If the argument is another method call like <code>li(&quot;One&quot;)</code> then <code>Builder li</code> gets executed, <code>Builder</code> can&#8217;t find a slot with that name, and <code>forward</code> gets called again. We are recursing now, and this will continue until we hit an argument that is a simple string, like <code>&quot;One&quot;</code>. When we do, <code>doMessage</code> will just turn that argument into a string. This leads to the second step:</li>

<li>If the executing argument is a simple string (<code>if(content type == &quot;Sequence&quot;,</code>) then print it out!</li>
</ol>

<p>That&#8217;s enough for a simple XML DSL in Io. The exercises are about taking this base and expanding it to handle attributes and generate xml with correct indentation. If you&#8217;re interested in seeing that, just scroll down to my full code listing!</p>
<h3>Operator Redefinition</h3>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve made it through that, let&#8217;s close with something easy. Exercise #2 was simple and served as a hint for the next one. In Io you can override what <code>{1, 2, 3}</code> means by putting a method into <code>curlyBrackets</code>. The contents <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code> will be available as the arguments of the message. If you were paying attention before, you&#8217;ll realize that we already know how to turn the message arguments into a list:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='io'>    <span class='c1'># 2. Create a list syntax that uses brackets</span>
    <span class='n'>curlyBrackets</span> <span class='o'>:=</span> <span class='k'>method</span><span class='o'>(</span>
        <span class='n'>call</span> <span class='n'>message</span> <span class='n'>arguments</span>
    <span class='o'>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>So that&#8217;s all that is required to solve that! But that isn&#8217;t the typical way to redefine operators in Io. I&#8217;ll leave you with a final example that shows you how to tell Io &#8220;when I use the <code>:</code> operator, I really want you to call the <code>atPutNumber</code> method instead&#8221;.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='io'>    <span class='n'>OperatorTable</span> <span class='n'>addAssignOperator</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;:&quot;</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='s'>&quot;atPutNumber&quot;</span><span class='o'>)</span>

    <span class='n'>Map</span> <span class='n'>atPutNumber</span> <span class='o'>:=</span> <span class='k'>method</span><span class='o'>(</span>

  Seven Languages: Week 2 (Io) - Day 2
  </a></h1>
  <div class="faded" style="font-size:14px; margin-bottom:5px;">11 Jan 2012</div>
  <p>Day 2 of Io was the most difficult (as well as the most fun) day yet. It took me quite a while to finish all the exercises to my satisfaction, and it also had the most interesting exercises so far. One in particular (transposing a matrix) was <a href='/blog/2011/12/30/transposing-a-matrix-in-io/'>my favorite.</a>.</p>
<div class='interjection'><p>
(This article is part of a series of posts I am doing about my journey through the exercises of the book <a href='http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks'>Seven Languages In Seven Weeks</a>. The article previous to this one is <a href='/blog/2011/12/18/seven-languages-week-2-day-1/'>Week 2 (Io) - Day 1</a>. For an overview see the <a href='/projects/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/'>project page</a>.)
</p></div>
<h2 id='topics_covered'>Topics covered</h2>

<p>Day 2 of Io went over some basic topics (conditionals, loops and operators) as well as some more complex subjects (messages and reflection).</p>

<p>Messages are a fundamental part of Io - except for comments and commas, everything is a message. Once I began thinking like this, something clicked for me. I started to really grok the code examples, and thinking and coding in Io felt easier, more natural.</p>

<p>Io has simple, straightforward reflection: it actually isn&#8217;t a burden to use or read. Combined with Io&#8217;s other design decisions this gives you quite a lot of power. You get ultimate control over your code, and the power to do whatever you can think of with it - no restriction can stand in your way.</p>

<p>I wonder if this is how Lisp programmers have been feeling for decades.</p>

<h2 id='a_note_about_the_io_community'>A note about the Io community</h2>

<p>While trying to find a way to write a short solution to #5, I ran across what turned out to be a bug in Io&#8217;s Range library. Thanks to the well-thought out questions in Day 1, I already had a list of places to go for help. In the #io channel on freenode I had the good luck to run into <a href='http://jeremy.tregunna.ca/'>Jeremy Tregunna</a> and told him my problem. In a remarkably short period of time (minutes) he had confirmed that it was actually a bug, made the fix, and had a pull request created on the main Io repository on github. Shortly thereafter the patch was merged into the master branch where I downloaded it, compiled it, and could run my previously-broken code!</p>

<p>It was a surprising and pleasant experience for me, and I&#8217;d like to thank Jeremy in particular and the Io community in general for being so friendly, supportive, and quick. Thank you!</p>

<h2 id='highlights_from_exercises'>Highlights from exercises</h2>

<p>It was harder to pick out only a few to highlight - most of these questions were fun to solve and had interesting solutions.</p>

<p>The one that I liked best was <a href='/blog/2011/12/30/transposing-a-matrix-in-io/'>transposing a matrix</a>, and I felt there was enough good material in there to warrant an article of its own.</p>

<p>The solution for Question #2 was unexpectedly straightforward. Once again, Io&#8217;s absolute flexibility and willingness to let you shoot yourself in the foot pays off! The question was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2. How would you change / to return 0 if the denominator is zero?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer was only two short lines of code:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='io'>    <span class='n'>Number</span> <span class='n'>origDiv</span> <span class='o'>:=</span> <span class='n'>Number</span> <span class='n'>getSlot</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;/&quot;</span><span class='o'>)</span>
    <span class='n'>Number</span> <span class='o'>/</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='k'>method</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='n'>denom</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>if</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='n'>denom</span> <span class='o'>==</span> <span class='mf'>0</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='mf'>0</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='n'>self</span> <span class='n'>origDiv</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='n'>denom</span><span class='o'>)))</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The tricky part at first was figuring out how to save a reference to the original division method, but in retrospect it was blindingly obvious. It&#8217;s the same things I&#8217;ve been doing all along with Io: taking things out of slots and putting things in slots!</p>

<p>I would also like to highlight Question #3 to show off how clean writing in a functional style is in Io. The question was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3. Write a program to add up all of the numbers in a two-dimensional array.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No loops needed here - Io has <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>reduce</code>, and they mix <strong>well</strong> with Io&#8217;s syntax:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='io'>    <span class='n'>addUp2DArray</span> <span class='o'>:=</span> <span class='k'>method</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='n'>array</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='n'>array</span> <span class='n'>flatten</span> <span class='n'>reduce</span><span class='o'>(+))</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That&#8217;s it for the highlights, but as I mentioned earlier, all of the exercises today were pretty interesting. Here is my full code listing for the exercises from Day 2 of Io. The home of this piece of code is with the other exercises <a href='https://github.com/nickknw/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/blob/master/week-2-io/day2.io'>on github</a>. These exercises this week are really worth taking a look at, I hope you read through some of the following.</p>

  Transposing a matrix in Io
  </a></h1>
  <div class="faded" style="font-size:14px; margin-bottom:5px;">30 Dec 2011</div>
  <p>While doing the exercises from Seven Languages In Seven Weeks, I came up with a neat solution to transposing a matrix that was encouraged by Io&#8217;s flexibility and free-wheeling nature. Instead of creating a new transposed matrix or attempting a complicated in-place transpose, I did something that executes in O(1), uses a negligible amount of memory, and is very short and simple.</p>

<p>What? How is it possible to transpose a matrix of 1,000,000 elements in the same time it takes to transpose a matrix of 4?</p>

<p>By cheating! I <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> transpose the matrix, I modify the element accessor methods so that they interpret the <code>x</code> parameter as <code>y</code>, and vice versa. To my dismay, I later found that <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose#Implementation_of_matrix_transposition_on_computers'>this isn&#8217;t a new approach</a> to solving this problem.</p>

<p>However, my implementation in Io still has something going for it. Because of Io&#8217;s extreme malleability, I can write my <code>transpose</code> method such that calling it permanently swaps the argument order in the <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> methods of that individual matrix object. In most other languages <a href='#footnote-1' class='super' id='footnote-1-link'>[1]</a> , writing this kind of fake transpose would require keeping track of state with if statements to check if a given matrix is currently &#8216;transposed&#8217; or not. This is, conceptually, nonsense: transposing is something you <em>do to</em> matrices, not a <em>property</em> of them.</p>

<p>Io lets you write this fake transpose in a way that is fun, short, and elegant.</p>

<h2 id='the_solution'>The Solution</h2>

<p>Here is the problem statement from the book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Write a transpose method so that (new_matrix get(y, x)) == matrix get(x,y) on the original list</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before we get started, this is what the final solution looks like. Try and become a little familiar with this before we move on (it will all be explained in detail below, don&#8217;t worry).</p>

</code></pre>
</div>
<p>List2D is a simple matrix prototype from the previous exercise. It is the thing that is being transposed.</p>

<p>The <code>transpose</code> method itself is simple enough: most of the heavy lifting is done in a helper method I created, <code>flipFirstTwoArgs</code>. From its name and the name of its argument, we can tell this method is saying: &#8220;give me the name of a slot that holds a method and I will flip the first two arguments of that method&#8221;.</p>

<p>Okay. So, how?</p>

<h2 id='the_explanation'>The Explanation</h2>

<p>The following line of code gets the method we are going to modify and sets the names of its arguments.</p>

<p>For a concrete example, if I just wanted to change the argument names for my &#8220;get&#8221; method from get(x, y) to get(y, x) I could hardcode in some values and call it like this:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='io'>    <span class='n'>self</span> <span class='n'>getSlot</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;get&quot;</span><span class='o'>)</span> <span class='n'>setArgumentNames</span><span class='o'>(</span>
        <span class='n'>list</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;y&quot;</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='s'>&quot;x&quot;</span><span class='o'>)</span>
    <span class='o'>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>But that wouldn&#8217;t quite be fancy enough. I&#8217;d rather write a method that would let me swap the first two arguments of <strong>any</strong> method. So, going back to the snippet above, that&#8217;s what the next two lines do:</p>

<p><strong>Lines 2-3:</strong></p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='io'>    <span class='n'>self</span> <span class='n'>getSlot</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='n'>slotName</span><span class='o'>)</span> <span class='n'>argumentNames</span> <span class='n'>at</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='mf'>1</span><span class='o'>),</span>
    <span class='n'>self</span> <span class='n'>getSlot</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='n'>slotName</span><span class='o'>)</span> <span class='n'>argumentNames</span> <span class='n'>at</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='mf'>0</span><span class='o'>),</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If I wanted to keep the arguments in the same order I would have put the <code>0</code> in the first line, then the <code>1</code> in the second line. Make sense so far?</p>

<p>I could have left it here, but then what would happen if I told it to change a method that looked like <code>doSomething(x, y, z)</code>? It would take the argument at position <code>1</code>, then the argument at position <code>0</code>. The <code>z</code> would get discarded and that method wouldn&#8217;t be very useful anymore. Hence the next line:</p>

<p><strong>Line 4:</strong></p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='io'>    <span class='n'>self</span> <span class='n'>getSlot</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='n'>slotName</span><span class='o'>)</span> <span class='n'>argumentNames</span> <span class='n'>rest</span> <span class='n'>rest</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><code>rest</code> is Io&#8217;s version of <code>cdr</code> or <code>tail</code>. It is a method that returns everything except for the first element of a list. So if you call <code>rest</code> on the result of <code>rest</code> you get a list that has all its elements except for the first two.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s recap. If I call this method we&#8217;re defining with my fictitious <code>doSomething(x, y, z)</code> method as the argument, these previous lines would resolve into:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='io'>    <span class='n'>self</span> <span class='n'>getSlot</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;doSomething&quot;</span><span class='o'>)</span> <span class='n'>setArgumentNames</span><span class='o'>(</span> <span class='n'>list</span><span class='o'>(</span>
        <span class='s'>&quot;y&quot;</span><span class='o'>,</span> 
        <span class='s'>&quot;x&quot;</span><span class='o'>,</span> 
        <span class='n'>list</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;z&quot;</span><span class='o'>)</span>
    <span class='o'>)</span> <span class='o'>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>That&#8217;s not quite right, <code>setArgumentNames</code> is expecting a simple flat list, none of this nested list stuff. So let&#8217;s flatten the list of argument names before giving it to <code>setArgumentNames</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Line 5:</strong></p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='io'>    <span class='o'>)</span> <span class='n'>flatten</span> <span class='o'>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If we apply it to the <code>doSomething</code> example, the code now looks like this:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='io'>    <span class='n'>self</span> <span class='n'>getSlot</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;doSomething&quot;</span><span class='o'>)</span> <span class='n'>setArgumentNames</span><span class='o'>(</span> <span class='n'>list</span><span class='o'>(</span>
        <span class='s'>&quot;y&quot;</span><span class='o'>,</span> 
        <span class='s'>&quot;x&quot;</span><span class='o'>,</span> 
        <span class='n'>list</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;z&quot;</span><span class='o'>)</span>
    <span class='o'>)</span> <span class='n'>flatten</span> <span class='o'>)</span> 
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Which would end up resolving into:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='io'>    <span class='n'>self</span> <span class='n'>getSlot</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;doSomething&quot;</span><span class='o'>)</span> <span class='n'>setArgumentNames</span><span class='o'>(</span>
        <span class='n'>list</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;y&quot;</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='s'>&quot;x&quot;</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='s'>&quot;z&quot;</span><span class='o'>)</span> 
    <span class='o'>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>There, much better. And that explains the last line!</p>

<h2 id='wrapup'>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>Now, putting back together all the lines I&#8217;ve explained, here is the body of the <code>flipFirstTwoArgs</code> method again:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='io'>    <span class='n'>self</span> <span class='n'>getSlot</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='n'>slotName</span><span class='o'>)</span> <span class='n'>setArgumentNames</span><span class='o'>(</span> <span class='n'>list</span><span class='o'>(</span>
        <span class='n'>self</span> <span class='n'>getSlot</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='n'>slotName</span><span class='o'>)</span> <span class='n'>argumentNames</span> <span class='n'>at</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='mf'>1</span><span class='o'>),</span>
        <span class='n'>self</span> <span class='n'>getSlot</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='n'>slotName</span><span class='o'>)</span> <span class='n'>argumentNames</span> <span class='n'>at</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='mf'>0</span><span class='o'>),</span>
        <span class='n'>self</span> <span class='n'>getSlot</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='n'>slotName</span><span class='o'>)</span> <span class='n'>argumentNames</span> <span class='n'>rest</span> <span class='n'>rest</span>
    <span class='o'>)</span> <span class='n'>flatten</span><span class='o'>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If I&#8217;ve done my job right, it should make a lot more sense this time.</p>

  Seven Languages: Week 2 (Io) - Day 1
  </a></h1>
  <div class="faded" style="font-size:14px; margin-bottom:5px;">18 Dec 2011</div>
  <p>Day 1 of Io is the first of many chapters that will give me that &#8216;new at programming&#8217; feeling again, where I fumble just trying to build a valid expression that does what I want it to. I actually like that feeling; it means I am learning something new and a web of structures is forming in my mind. I like it <em>almost</em> as much as finally making that first deep connection from a group of new concepts to some of your existing ones, and starting to grasp the parallels. Fortunately for me, that is what this book is all about!</p>
<div class='interjection'><p>
(This article is part of a series of posts I am doing about my journey through the exercises of the book <a href='http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks'>Seven Languages In Seven Weeks</a>. The article previous to this one is <a href='/blog/2011/12/15/seven-languages-week-1-day-3/'>Week 1 (Ruby) - Day 3</a>. For an overview see the <a href='/projects/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/'>project page</a>.)

<h2 id='how_io_feels'>How Io feels</h2>

<p>Syntactically, Io is a very very lightweight language, evocative of lisps in its regularity and minimalism. It provides a nice contrast with the previous chapter on Ruby. Ruby&#8217;s definition of simple code is something like &#8220;The more an expression reads like a (succinct) explanation of its intent, the better&#8221; whereas Io&#8217;s definition of simple code is something like &#8220;The less extraneous syntax that is needed to represent an expression, the better&#8221;.</p>

<p>Because of this approach, Io lends itself very well to metaprogramming &#8211; at least as well as Ruby does, possibly better. It does not have as the wide and varied set of built-in metaprogramming tools that Ruby does, but it also needs far fewer due to the way the language is constructed. Io is a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming'>prototype-based</a> language, the first of the less familiar programming paradigms in this book. I won&#8217;t go into depth about this here except to note that Javascript is prototype-based as well, so learning Io could be very beneficial to anyone that does a fair amount of programming Javascript.</p>

<h2 id='highlights_from_exercises'>Highlights from exercises</h2>

<p>The homework this week is short but well-constructed. It points out a couple of things that are important to remember for a newbie to Io. In particular, you will need <code>slotNames</code> a lot, so remember that one!</p>

<p>Other than that, there isn&#8217;t much to say about the homework this week. Remember <code>slotNames</code> and read the code listing.</p>
